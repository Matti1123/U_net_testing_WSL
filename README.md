# U-Net Testing

This repository is for testing a simple U-Net segmentation setup using Python, PyTorch, and MONAI in WSL.  
The goal is to verify that the environment, virtual environment, and dependencies are working correctly.  
A small dummy image will be used to run a quick segmentation.  
All experiments will run on CPU in WSL, no GPU is required.  

The project structure includes folders for data, notebooks, and scripts.  
A virtual environment is used to keep dependencies isolated.  
.gitignore is set to exclude the venv, large data files, and temporary files.  
After setup, we can run a minimal U-Net example to confirm everything is working.
